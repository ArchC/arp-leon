or implied.

This is ARP LEON3 Single CPU Platform. It consists of a Leon3/Sparc V8 processor 
simulator tied to grlib components by ArchC 2.0 TLM port. This platform uses the 
following component and buses:ju

LEON3:   A LEON3/SPARC V8 CPU with a full Integer Unit and Traps/Interruption
		 support.
IRQMP:   Interrupt multiprocessor Controller
Memory:  A generic memory to simulate RAM/ROM types
GPTIMER: General Purpose Timer Unit
APBUART: UART unit to print serial I/O
Router:  A simple Router to simulate
SRMMU:   A Memory Management Unit

This platform can boot and run a Linux 2.0 and 2.6 kernel and has a partial 
support to SMP (Simetric Multiprocessing) and partial support to kernel 3.0.
Some patches and modifications have to be applied to generated acsim simulator 
to support many  features due some restrictions. At SW folder we have some 
code and kernel image samples.

Run this example:
- Install ARP
  - See toplevel README for notes on system requirements
- Unpack the platform package (probably done :)
  $./arp --unpack leon3.arp.pack
- Edit toplevel Makefile
  - Change the environment variables to correctly point ARCHC, SYSTEMC and TLM
  - Change PLATFORM to leon3.01
- Run example
  $make run
